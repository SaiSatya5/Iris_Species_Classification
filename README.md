# Iris_Species_Classification
## Project Description

The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. A k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier is employed to achieve this classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset and you can get it from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains the following attributes:

- **sepal length**: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- **sepal width**: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- **petal length**: Length of the petal in centimeters
- **petal width**: Width of the petal in centimeters
- **species**: The species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
